## Make Change Project

### Overview 

This is program is a **cash register** *application* that asks the user to input the amount of an item they would like to purchase and the amount the user gave to the cashier to pay for that item. If the amount paid is not enough, it gives an error message. If the amount paid equals the price of the item, it will give a message that says the exact amount was provided. If the amount paid is more than the price of the item then the cash register application determines how much change the user will receive, to include the amount of each bill/cent ($20, $10, $1, 25c, 10c, 5c, 1c).

### Concepts
Methods
if Statements
Modulo Operators
The printf() Method
Casting

### Technologies Used

* Java
* Eclipse

### Lessons Learned
* I learned how to proficiently use if statements and how to stack them when needed. 
* The print f() method allowed me to counteract the number of decimal places that were being output by double numbers.
* Casting allowed me to produce an integer when multiplying with a double.
* I learned that using methods makes it easier to identify an issue you in your code. Throughout my code testing I ran into issues and could not identify the core problem because I put all of my code in the main at first.
*I learned how to use the modulo operator to determine how much change was needed for each bill/cent.
